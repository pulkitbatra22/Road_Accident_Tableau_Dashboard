I have tried to make a dynamic Tableau dashboard for analyzing road accidents, featuring filters for comparing years and severity. It showcases various KPIs, charts, such as area, line, and bar, and custom visualizations (donut charts) to analyze casualties by factors like vehicle type, weather, road surface, and location.
